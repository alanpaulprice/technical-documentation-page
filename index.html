<!--
#1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains
the page's main content (technical documentation).
#2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with
a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
#3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which
contains text that describes the topic of that section.
#4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id
that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces
should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header
"Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").
#5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
#6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
#7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
#8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
#9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that
describes the topic of the technical documentation.
#10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of
nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
#11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in
the navbar.
#12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds
to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world"
section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
#13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding
section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains
the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id
and contains the corresponding header.

#14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar"
should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
#15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.

        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
          It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
          (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects
          of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for
          a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
          example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.</li>
        </ul>

        <header>What You Should Already Know</header>
        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
            (WWW).</li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try
            one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="javascript_and_java" class="main-section">
        <header>Javascript and Java</header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
          follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
          control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from
          LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
          objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special
          declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
          executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected,
          and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
          function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

      <section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
          <pre><code>
              function greetMe(yourName) {
                alert("Hello " + yourName);
              }
              greetMe("World");
            </code></pre>
          <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in
            your browser!</p>
